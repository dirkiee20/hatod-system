- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach for all screen sizes
- **Complete Food Ordering Flow** - Browse restaurants, view menus, cart, checkout, and order tracking

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Build the CSS:**
```bash
npm run build:css
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
npm start
```
This will:
- Build the CSS
- Start a local web server on port 8080
- Automatically open your browser

### Option 2: Development Mode

**Terminal 1 - Watch CSS changes:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This watches for CSS changes and rebuilds automatically.

**Terminal 2 - Start web server:**
```bash
npm run serve
```
This starts a local server on `http://localhost:8080`

### Option 3: Manual Server Setup

If you don't want to use the npm script, you can use any of these methods:

**Using Python (if installed):**
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

**Using PHP (if installed):**
```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```

**Using VS Code Live Server:**
- Install the "Live Server" extension
- Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

## 🎨 Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The CSS is organized into:
- `css/tailwind.css` - Tailwind source file with custom utilities
- `css/main.css` - Compiled CSS (generated by Tailwind)
- `css/pages.css` - Page-specific custom styles

## 🧩 Customization

To customize the Tailwind configuration, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## 📦 Available Scripts

- `npm run build:css` - Build CSS once (for production)
- `npm run watch:css` - Watch for CSS changes and rebuild automatically
- `npm run serve` - Start a local web server on port 8080
- `npm start` - Build CSS and start server (all-in-one command)
- `npm run dev` - Watch CSS changes (development mode)

## 📱 Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

- **Main Application:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Direct Pages:**
  - Browse Restaurants: `http://localhost:8080/pages/restaurant_browse.html`
  - Customer Login: `http://localhost:8080/pages/customer_login.html`
  - Restaurant Login: `http://localhost:8080/pages/restaurant_login.html`
  - Admin Dashboard: `http://localhost:8080/pages/admin_dashboard.html`

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is built with responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints:

- `sm`: 640px and up
- `md`: 768px and up
- `lg`: 1024px and up
- `xl`: 1280px and up
- `2xl`: 1536px and up

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CSS not loading?
Make sure you've built the CSS first:
```bash
npm run build:css
```

### Port already in use?
Change the port in the serve script:
```bash
npx http-server . -p 3000
```

### Styles not updating?
- Make sure `watch:css` is running in development
- Clear your browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## 📝 Notes

- The application uses static HTML files - no backend is required for the frontend
- All data is currently mocked/static for demonstration purposes
- For production, you'll need to connect to a backend API
